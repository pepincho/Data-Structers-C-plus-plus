# Implementation of essential data structers in C++.

## 1. [Stack with Linked Nodes] (https://github.com/pepincho/Data-Structures-C-plus-plus/tree/master/dynamic-Stack-with-LinkedNodes) - an linked implementation of a FILO stack

The size of the stack grows and shrinks dynamically depending on the number of stored elements.

The memory for the elements is allocated on the heap.

## 2. [Queue with Linked Nodes] (https://github.com/pepincho/Data-Structures-C-plus-plus/tree/master/dynamic-Queue-with-LinkedNodes) - an linked implementation of a FIFO queue

The size of the queue grows and shrinks dynamically depending on the number of stored elements.

The memory for the elements is allocated on the heap.

## 3. [Queue with static array] (https://github.com/pepincho/Data-Structures-C-plus-plus/tree/master/static-Queue-with-array) - a static implementation of a FIFO queue

## 4. [Linked List with merge sort] (https://github.com/pepincho/Data-Structures-C-plus-plus/tree/master/LinkedList-with-merge-sort)

## 5. [Binary Search Tree - BST] (https://github.com/pepincho/Data-Structures-C-plus-plus/tree/master/Binary-Search-Tree)

## 6. [Min Binary Heap] (https://github.com/pepincho/Data-Structures-C-plus-plus/tree/master/Min-Binary-Heap)

## 7. [Trie (prefix tree)] (https://github.com/pepincho/Data-Structures-C-plus-plus/tree/master/Trie-prefix-tree)

## 8. [Dynamic Array] (https://github.com/pepincho/Data-Structures-C-plus-plus/tree/master/Dynamic-Array)
