# Implementation of essential data structers in C++.

## 1. Stack with Linked Nodes - an linked implementation of a FILO stack

The size of the stack grows and shrinks dynamically depending on the number of stored elements.

The memory for the elements is allocated on the heap.

## 2. Queue with Linked Nodes - an linked implementation of a FIFO queue

The size of the queue grows and shrinks dynamically depending on the number of stored elements.

The memory for the elements is allocated on the heap.

## 3. Queue with static array - a static implementation of a FIFO queue

## 4. Linked List with merge sort

## 5. Binary Search Tree - BST

## 6. Min Binary Heap

## 7. Trie (prefix tree)

## 7. Dynamic Array
